**📌 Project Title:** Travel Planner Blog Web Application

**👩‍💻 Developed by:** Sumana Angajala

---

### 📝 Overview

The **Travel Planner Blog** is a feature-rich, interactive, and fully responsive web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The app is designed as a one-stop platform for travelers to document trips, manage itineraries, view image galleries, and prepare packing lists — all wrapped inside a beautifully styled, clean, and professional theme.

This project was developed as the **final task** for the Apex Planet Internship program, and it successfully integrates multiple user-centric features while preserving the original theme and UI consistency.
